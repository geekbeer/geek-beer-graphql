# Geek Beer GraphQL

The Geek Beer GraphQL server provides data and content for geekbeer.se and other clients.

## Development
For local development you need to have a Contentful access token and space ID for the Geek Beer Space. To obtain an access token and space id send a DM to Jörgen Nilsson in the [Geek Beer Slack Channel](https://geekbeer-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and he will sort you out.

## Installation
* `git clone git@github.com:geekbeer/geek-beer-graphql.git`
* `npm install or yarn install`
* `npm run dev` to start local development
